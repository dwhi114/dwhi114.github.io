The goal of this project was to recreate the game of Simon, yet a bit simpler and with some musical element.
The shapes on screen with be randomly selected and filled in with a color, which corresponds to a light on the Arduino setup.
If the user inputs a joystick direction that corresponds to the shape that was chosen, a point is given.
The melody sequence is also played at different octaves depending on which is randomly shape is randomly selected.
The game could be played entirely by choosing one of these avenues, either looking solely at the shapes, looking at the arduino, or listening for the music.
